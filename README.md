# Ethereal-Roblox-Game
This repository has all the source code for my Roblox game. There are multiple scripts in different areas of the game structure and they will be organized in the same way for ease of understanding. Each area of the game structure is in a different branch with the seperate scripts inside. All scripts are Module Scripts unless otherwise labelled: a LocalScript executes on a player's device, handling client-side functions while a ModuleScript stores reusable code or data accessible by multiple scripts on both the server and client sides of the game. The main coding involved with this project was for the GUI and interactive elements for the player to try on and purchase the clothing. 

Here are the different areas used on Roblox and what they entail:
ReplicatedStorage: a shared repository for game assets that require synchronized access by both the server and all connected players
StarterGui: where the initial user interface elements are placed for players to see in the game
