# Ethereal-Roblox-Game
This repository has all the source code for my Roblox game. There are multiple scripts in different areas of the game structure and they will be organized in the same way for ease of understanding. 
Here are the different areas used on Roblox and what they entail:
ReplicatedStorage: a shared repository for game assets that require synchronized access by both the server and all connected players
StarterGui: where the initial user interface elements are placed for players to see in the game
